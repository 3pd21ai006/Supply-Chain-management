# Supply-Chain-management

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing product performance and supply chain efficiency using a dataset collected from a Fashion and Beauty startup specializing in Makeup products. The goal is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, supply chain optimization, and customer demographics.

Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

Product Type: Type of makeup product.

SKU: Stock Keeping Unit identifier.

Price: Product price.

Availability: Product availability status.

Number of Products Sold: Quantity of products sold.

Revenue Generated: Revenue earned from sales.

Customer Demographics: Information on customers (e.g., age, gender, location).

Stock Levels: Inventory levels for each SKU.

Lead Times: Time taken to deliver products from suppliers.

Order Quantities: Quantities ordered by customers.

Shipping Times: Time taken for shipping products.

Shipping Carriers: Names of shipping providers.

Shipping Costs: Costs associated with shipping products.

Supplier Name: Name of the product supplier.

Location: Geographic location of suppliers and customers.

Production Volumes: Quantity of products manufactured.

Manufacturing Lead Time: Time taken to manufacture products.

Manufacturing Costs: Costs incurred during production.

Inspection Results: Outcomes of quality inspections.

Defect Rates: Percentage of defective products.

Transportation Modes: Modes of transportation used (e.g., air, sea, road).

Routes: Shipping routes.

Costs: Overall costs incurred.

Project Tasks

1. Dataset Preparation

Ensure that the dataset contains all the features listed above. Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting to make the dataset analysis-ready.

2. Visualizations

Product Performance Dashboard

Product Sales: Create a bar chart showing the number of products sold for each product type.

Revenue Analysis: Generate a line chart showing revenue over time, filtered by product type.

Price Distribution: Use a histogram to show price distribution for different product types.

Stock Levels: Create a heatmap to visualize stock levels across different SKUs and product types.

Supply Chain Efficiency Dashboard

Lead Times vs. Order Quantities: Use a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between lead times and order quantities for different suppliers.

Shipping Costs by Carrier: Create a bar chart showing shipping costs per carrier, with a filter for location-based analysis.

Manufacturing Efficiency: Develop a dual-axis chart showing manufacturing lead time and production volumes over time.

Defect Rates: Create a pie chart or bar chart to visualize defect rates by supplier name or location.

Customer Demographics

Demographic Breakdown: Generate a demographic distribution chart (e.g., pie or stacked bar chart) to display customer breakdown by age group, gender, or other available demographics.

Revenue by Demographics: Create a treemap showing revenue generated by different customer demographics.

Analysis Questions

Which product type generates the highest revenue?

Are there significant correlations between lead times and order quantities?

How do shipping costs vary by carrier and location?

Which suppliers have the most efficient manufacturing processes based on manufacturing lead time and production volumes?

Which demographic group contributes the most to sales?

Storytelling

Combine all visualizations into a Tableau story that:

Walks through product performance insights.

Highlights supply chain efficiency metrics.

Presents customer demographic findings.

Features to Include:

Interactive filters for users to explore the data.

Tooltips with additional details (e.g., SKU, Supplier name).

Tools and Technologies

Data Analysis and Visualization: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau

Data Storage: CSV files or SQL databases

Version Control: Git and GitHub
